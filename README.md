# Openshift Developer Focussed Demos

## Introduction
We have created several simple developer focussed Openshift Demos and recorded them. There are 2 versions - a short one and a longer one. With each, we provide an introduction as well as instructions to set them up and demo them yourself.

### Main demonstrations
With each demonstration, we provide you with a brief description as well as the starting time in the video for that demo. In the sub-folders **_1-demos-setup_** and **_2-demos-execution_**, you'll find instructions to setup and run that demo.

#### 1. Load testing and auto-scaling demo - available at start of recording
In this demo we configure a local load testing tool (in our case JMeter) to hit an Openshift based Spring Boob REST API. This Openshift deployment has been condigured to auto-scale. The demo involves firsing the load, waiting a couple of minutes to see it scale up and another couple of mintes to see it scale down.
