### Assumptions / Notes I made. Correct as appropriate for your setup
- developer user has credentials developer:developer
- admin user has credentials system:admin
- Using a self signed cert which requires relaxing security stringencies (--insecure-skip-tls-verify)
- I use my names for projects and apps - you probably want to name your differently
- Open JDK image streams are already available. If not run this as admin: 
  - oc create -f ./openjdk-s2i-imagestream.json -n openshift
- Substitute your routes/URLS for my example ones
- Some commands are deprecated. These will be fioxed ina future release
- For more complete documentation on setting up the API Gateway see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/2.2/html/deployment_options/apicast-openshift


### Steps
- **_Create Projects_**
