### Assumptions / Notes I made. Correct as appropriate for your setup
- developer user has credentials developer:developer
- admin user has credentials system:admin
- Using a self signed cert which requires relaxing security stringencies (--insecure-skip-tls-verify)
- I use my names for projects and apps - you probably want to name your differently
- Open JDK image streams are already available. If not run this as admin: 
  - oc create -f ./openjdk-s2i-imagestream.json -n openshift
- Substitute your routes/URLS for my example ones
- Some commands are deprecated. These will be fioxed ina future release
- This example is taken from the excellent e-book *Devops with Openshift* available for free download at https://www.openshift.com/devops-with-openshift/. Check it out!


### Steps
- **_Create Projects_**  
  - oc login https://your-openshift-host -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  - oc new-project bluegreen --display-name="Blue Green Deployments" --description="Blue Green Deployments"
- **_Create and test app_**  
  - oc new-app https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/bluegreen#master --name=blue
  - oc expose service blue --name=bluegreen
    - **_Take note of the route Openshift creates for you. Something like http://bluegreen-bluegreen.apps.1111.example.opentlc.com/ _**  
  - oc new-app https://github.com/devops-with-openshift/bluegreen#green --name=green
  - **_switch service to green and test_**  
    - oc patch route/bluegreen -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"green"}}}'
    - http://bluegreen-bluegreen.apps.1111.example.opentlc.com/
  - **_switch service to blue and test_**  
    - oc patch route/bluegreen -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"blue"}}}'
    - http://bluegreen-bluegreen.apps.1111.example.opentlc.com/
