### Assumptions / Notes I made. Correct as appropriate for your setup
- developer user has credentials developer:developer
- admin user has credentials system:admin
- Using a self signed cert which requires relaxing security stringencies (--insecure-skip-tls-verify)
- I use my names for projects and apps - you probably want to name your differently
- Open JDK image streams are already available. If not run this as admin: 
  - oc create -f ./openjdk-s2i-imagestream.json -n openshift
- Substitute your routes/URLS for my example ones
- Some commands are deprecated. These will be fioxed ina future release
- For more complete documentation on setting up the API Gateway see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/2.2/html/deployment_options/apicast-openshift


### Steps
- **_Create Projects_**  
  - oc login https://your-openshift-host -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  - oc project springboot-tc (**_your S2I project from step 3_**)
  - oc secret new-basicauth apicast-configuration-url-secret --password=https://**_3scaleAccessToken_**@**_3scalehost_**
  - oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3scale/apicast/master/openshift/apicast-template.yml
  - **_we expose the gateway and delete direct access to the API. The gateway talks to the API via the Openshift service host name_**  
    - oc expose service apicast
    - oc delete route springboot
  - **_NOW API is Protected_**
    - http://apicast-springboot.apps.1111.example.opentlc.com:80/flights/intl/flights?user_key=yourUserKey
  - **_AND calls are recorded_**
    - On your 3scale account, navigate to Analytics -> (your API) -> Usage. Each call is reported.
