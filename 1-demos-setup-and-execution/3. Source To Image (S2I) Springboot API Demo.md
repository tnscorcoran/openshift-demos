### Assumptions / Notes I made. Correct as appropriate for your setup
- developer user has credentials developer:developer
- admin user has credentials system:admin
- Using a self signed cert which requires relaxing security stringencies (--insecure-skip-tls-verify)
- I use my names for projects and apps - you probably want to name your differently
- Open JDK image streams are already available. If not run this as admin: 
  - oc create -f ./openjdk-s2i-imagestream.json -n openshift
- Substitute your routes/URLS for my example ones
- Some commands are deprecated. These will be fioxed ina future release


### Steps
- **_Create Projects_**  
  - oc login https://your-openshift-host -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify
  - oc new-project springboot-tc
  - oc new-app openshift/redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.2~https://github.com/tnscorcoran/springboot.git
  - oc expose svc/springboot
  - **_Test it_**  
    - http://springboot-springboot-tc.apps.1111.example.opentlc.com/flights/intl/flights
