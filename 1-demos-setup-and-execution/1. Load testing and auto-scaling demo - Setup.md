### Assumptions I made. Correct as appropriate for your setup
- developer user has credentials developer:developer
- admin user has credentials system:admin
- using a self signed cert which requires relaxing security stringencies (--insecure-skip-tls-verify)
- I use my names for projects and apps - you probably want to name your differently
- Open JDK image streams are already available. If not run this as admin: 
  - oc create -f ./openjdk-s2i-imagestream.json -n openshift
- Substitute your routes for my example ones


### Steps
- oc login https://your-openshift-host -u developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify
- oc new-project springboot-tc
- oc new-app openshift/redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.2~https://github.com/tnscorcoran/springboot.git
- oc expose svc/springboot
- Wait till deployed amd Test it

- Open JMeter and modify JMX for new Host (route above)
- Add CPU RESOURCE LIMIT
- Add autoscaler
- Open Blazemeter - https://a.blazemeter.com/app/#/
- Create a test with 8 concurrent users, 1 minute test and ramp up time 0
- Run test
- Watch Openshift scale up then down
